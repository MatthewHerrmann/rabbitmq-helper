# Remove All Queues on a RabbitMQ Node

While mostly for debugging/testing purposes, you can remove all queues using the following commandlet:

```powershell
Remove-RabbitMQQueues
```
***Previous versions of the Rabbit Helper used Remove-AllQueues. If you have this as an option when you run your Rabbit Helper if is recommended that you upgrade to the latest release of Helper.
